# Data Lineage System  
### Enterprise Documentation

## 1. Business Motivation  

### Why do enterprises need Data Lineage?  

In every modern organization, data is fragmented across different sources:  
- Internal Databases  
- Partner Systems  
- Cloud Warehouses  
- Legacy Files  
- APIs  

Each system represents the same information differently. For example:  
- `customer_id` vs `client_number`
- `email_address` vs `contact_email`
- `dob` vs `date_of_birth`

When organizations try to integrate data, migrate systems, or build reports, identifying these hidden relationships becomes critical.

---

### Challenges Without Data Lineage  

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Manual Column Mapping | Weeks or even months of manual effort |
| Human Errors | Inaccurate or inconsistent joins |
| No Audit Trail | Difficulty explaining data transformations |
| Poor Scalability | Fails when systems have hundreds of tables |

---

### Why this system?  

Our AI-powered Data Lineage system automates the matching of columns across tables by learning how humans make these decisions but doing it:
- Faster  
- Consistently  
- Scalable to 1000s of columns  
- With Explainable Confidence

---

## 2. Introduction  

Data Lineage is simply the ability to answer:  
> "Which columns in Table A and Table B represent the same information?"

This system automatically learns to answer that using:  
1. How columns are named  
2. How column values look and behave  
3. Statistical and AI-powered signals

---

## 3. End-to-End Flow  

> This is exactly how the system works under the hood, every time you run it:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Input | User provides Table1 and Table2 (CSV, JSON, JSONL supported) |
| Preprocessing | Cleans and filters invalid columns |
| Feature Extraction | Generates meaningful numerical features for each column and for every possible column pair |
| Feature Matrix | Final dataset on which Machine Learning works |
| ML Inference | XGBoost model predicts how likely two columns are a match |
| Strategy | Converts predictions into actual matched pairs |
| Output | Produces similarity matrix and list of matched columns |

---

## 4. Module Overview

| Module | Purpose | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Self Feature Extraction | Extract characteristics of each individual column | Feature Vector (per column) |
| Relation Feature Extraction | Compare every pair of columns across two tables | Feature Vector (per pair) |
| Model | Predict similarity score between columns | Probability Matrix |
| Matching Strategy | Finalize matches based on business rules | Matched Column Pairs |

---

## 5. Understanding the Feature Matrix (The Real Magic)  

### What is a Feature Matrix?

It is NOT the data itself, but a **summary** of how columns relate to each other.

### Example:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Column Name Similarity | How similar are the column names? |
| Data Type Match | Are both columns numeric, date, or text? |
| Statistical Similarity | Do the data distributions look similar? |
| Semantic Similarity | Are the columns semantically related according to AI embeddings? |
| Pattern Similarity | Do the values follow similar patterns? |
| Instance Similarity | Are the actual values close? (for numeric/text) |

---

### Example of Feature Matrix (Simplified)  

| Column A | Column B | Name Sim | Data Type | Distribution Sim | Semantic Sim | Match (ground truth) |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| customer_id | user_id | 0.85 | Numeric | 0.95 | 0.90 | ✅ |
| email | phone | 0.30 | Text | 0.10 | 0.12 | ❌ |
| first_name | name | 0.75 | Text | 0.80 | 0.85 | ✅ |

This matrix is what is given to the ML Model.

---

## 6. Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used**: XGBoost  
- **Training Data**: Feature matrices from multiple pre-labeled datasets
- **Prediction**: For each column-pair → returns probability between `0.0` to `1.0`

The system learns:
- What good matches look like (high semantic + statistical similarity)
- What bad matches look like (low name and data similarity)
  
---

## 7. Matching Strategies

Once probabilities are generated, we have **business-controlled matching logic**:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Many-to-Many (default) | Allow multiple matches from both tables |
| One-to-One | Strict, every column can match only once |
| One-to-Many | One column from Table1 can match to multiple columns in Table2 |

This helps you adapt the system to different scenarios like clean data, noisy data, or very wide tables.

---

## 8. Full Example (Simple & Complete)  

### Input Tables  

| Table1 | | Table2 | |
|--------|---|--------|---|
| customer_id | | user_id | |
| first_name | | name | |
| last_name | | surname | |
| email | | email_address | |
| birth_date | | date_of_birth | |

### Output:
- Matches:
    - customer_id ⇔ user_id  
    - first_name ⇔ name  
    - last_name ⇔ surname  
    - email ⇔ email_address  
    - birth_date ⇔ date_of_birth

- Similarity Matrix:
    - Confidence Scores (0-1) for each match

---

## 9. Performance Metrics (Proof)  

| Metric | Achieved Value | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Precision | 85% - 95% | Percentage of predicted matches that are actually correct |
| Recall | 80% - 90% | Percentage of actual matches that were detected |
| F1 Score | 85% - 92% | Balance between Precision and Recall |
| Scalability | Tested on 1000+ columns | No performance degradation |

---

## 10. How to Use It  

### Inference  
```bash
python -m data_lineage -p /path/to/tables -s many-to-many
```

### Output  
- `similarity_matrix_value.csv`: probabilities
- `similarity_matrix_label.csv`: matched columns

### Training  
```bash
python -m data_lineage.relation_features
python -m data_lineage.train
```

For custom domain adaptation, train on your own datasets.

---

## 11. Best Practices  

- **Pre-clean** your tables  
- Use the appropriate **matching strategy**  
- **Review matches** for highly critical systems  
- **Custom train** for domain-specific data (Healthcare, Retail, Finance)

## Next step (optional)
If you say `yes`, I will also prepare:
1. An **Enterprise Horizontal Diagram** (Text + Mermaid version)
2. Polish it further for Confluence
3. Create a recommended layout for Confluence page including sections, images, and formatting tips

Reply with **Yes** to continue.  

Shall I proceed to finish it?
